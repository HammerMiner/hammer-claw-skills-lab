# Hydro Light Control

Use this skill when the user wants to automatically turn off the water-cooling RGB LED after a delay or at a specific time.

## Tool Call Inputs

```json
{
  "path": "{CUR_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/watercooling_light_timer.lua",
  "args": {}
}
```

Pass an empty `args` object for defaults.

## Behavior

- Supports two modes: **Timer** (countdown) and **Schedule** (clock time).
- **Timer mode**: pick a preset (**15 min** / **30 min** / **1 hour** / **2 hours**) or adjust the value with the **-** / **+** buttons (1–999, minutes or hours).
- **Schedule mode**: wheel pickers set the target clock time (hour 0–23, minute 0–59) via the chevron buttons. The skill automatically rolls over to the next day if the time has already passed, and shows a live `HH:MM:SS` countdown below the summary while the timer is running.
- The power button toggles the ARGB LED immediately via `capability.call("miner_set_led_mode", { on = ... })`; the default LED color is applied via `capability.call("miner_set_led_color", { r, g, b })`.
- Displays the current timezone offset (e.g. `UTC+08:00`) on the top bar, derived from `system.time()` and `system.date()`.
- The user can press **Stop Timer** at any time to abort; switching modes or picking a preset also cancels the active timer.
